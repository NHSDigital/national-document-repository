at `./performance/tests/performance-venv`.

To activate the environment in Mac/Linux or UNIX based Windows terminal, run:
`source ./performance/tests/performance-env/bin/activate`

`./performance/tests/performance-env/Scripts/activate`

To activate in Windows terminals, run:

`./performance/tests/performance-env/Scripts/activate`

## Locust Setup
