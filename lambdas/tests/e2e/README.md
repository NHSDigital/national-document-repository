# üß™ End-to-End Testing Setup

These tests focus on the features of the NDR. This will serve as a blended suite of integration and end-to-end (E2E) tests, with the aim to validate API functionality and snapshot comparisons.

There are 2 suites which separately test

1. FHIR API endpoints using mTLS `lambdas/tests/e2e/api/fhir/` (routed to **PDM** usecase)
2. API endpoints **not** using mTLS `lambdas/tests/e2e/api/` (routed to **Lloyd George** usecase)

### üîê AWS Authentication

You must be authenticated with AWS to run the tests. Use the following commands with a configured profile set up in ~/.aws/config to authenticate:

```bash
aws sso login --profile <your-aws-profile>

export AWS_PROFILE=<your-aws-profile>
```

An example profile:

```bash
[sso-session PRM]
sso_start_url = https://d-9c67018f89.awsapps.com/start#
sso_region = eu-west-2

[profile NDR-Dev-RW]
sso_session=PRM
sso_account_id=<dev-aws-account-id>
sso_role_name=DomainCGpit-Administrators
region=eu-west-2
output=json
```

Make sure your AWS profile has access to the required resources.

## üîß Available Make Commands

- `make test-fhir-api-e2e WORKSPACE=<workspace>` ‚Äî Runs the FHIR API E2E tests with mTLS against a given workspace

- `make test-api-e2e` ‚Äî Runs the E2E tests without mTLS

### Snapshots

Snapshots reduce the amount of individual assertions by comparing pre and post an object e.g. a JSON returned from an API.

Snapshot testing is used in the non mTLS test suite only. To update snapshots you can run the following make command:

- `make test-api-e2e-snapshots` ‚Äî Runs snapshot comparison tests

This runs pytest with the additional argument `--snapshot-update` which will replace the existing snapshots.

### Certificate inspection

You can download the mTLS certificates used in the requests if you need to inspect them by running

- `make download-api-certs WORKSPACE=<workspace>` ‚Äî Downloads mTLS client cert and client key used in the request

‚ùó Always delete these after use and never commit them.

## üåç Required Environment Variables

In order to execute the E2E tests without mTLS (i.e. `make test-api-e2e`) you will need to ensure the following environment variables are set. You can export them in your shell configuration file (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`) or **temporarily** add them to the `conftest.py`:

| Environment Variable | Description                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NDR_API_KEY`        | The API key required to authenticate requests to the NDR API. API Gateway ‚Üí API Keys for associated env e.g. ndr-dev_apim-api-key |
| `NDR_API_ENDPOINT`   | The URI string used to connect to the NDR API.                                                                                    |
| `NDR_S3_BUCKET`      | The name of the Store e.g. ndr-dev-lloyd-george-store.                                                                            |
| `NDR_DYNAMO_STORE`   | The name of the Reference Data Store e.g. ndr-dev_LloydGeorgeReferenceMetadata.                                                   |
| `MOCK_CIS2_KEY`      | The value of the Mock CIS2 Key. Found in Parameter Store: /auth/password/MOCK_KEY                                                 |

After updating your shell config, reload it:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc   # or source ~/.bashrc
```
