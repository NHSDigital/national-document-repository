Rotherham meeting notes 07-10-2022
Sally Atkinson
Tracey Holmes - contact centre manager.

AL: No unattended access API for at least a year

SA: Trying to streamline process as it stands, not needing individual smartcard access

SA: They're hoping to automate the process of downloading from e-RS

SA: Event reports come out of e-RS

SA: Don't pull referral into medtech until appointment booked.
	e-RS system logs user out every 3 minutes!
	e-RS system - Appointmenr Slot Issues to see incoming referrals
	Click on UBRN - Review Referral
	(Clinician doesn't book the appointment)
	Record Triage outcome - most likely accept and refer or return to referrer
	Moves into Appointments for Booking list
	Then booked in, which generates the pathway on Meditech (with a Unique pathway identifier, then the last 12 digits being the UBRN frome-RS)
	This is the point they need to pull attachments over.

//Medtech looks like an early XP app!!! Or is that a win 95/98 look feel? 

SA: Pull up a list in medtech of referal status of e-RS and you can see there is no image attached
	Open the referal click on scan select the folder with the attachments and it will attach all files in that folder
	Will confirm uploadable file types
	Automating document download will save 60-75%
	Sometimes multipage documents will be stored as a file per document
	Currently doing about 15 documents an hour on downloading/converting/saving.
	
	Process due to change with triaging done in meditech instead of e-RS. Trigger point for attachment download is unchanged - booking created with status of e-RS.
	Will send flow diagrams on.
	
	Do not go back and add new documents to existing referrals.
	No way to distinguish different referrals for same patient except the UBRN
